I've decided to create a blog. Like, a bloggy blog. No idea how long this will last or if I'll stick to it, but I figure it's best to at least have it in case I want to use it.

I like the idea of being able to mark down and style up my own social posts however I want, without a character limit or fear of being lost in a feed.

So... here I am! Hello, world!
