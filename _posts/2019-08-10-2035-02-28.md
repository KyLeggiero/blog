From the Wright brothers' first flight in Kitty Hawk, until Neil Armstrong's first footstep on the moon, it had been [just over 65 and a half years](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=December+14,+1903+to+July+21,+1969).
At the time of writing, we have just over 16 and a half years until 2035-02-28. At that point, it will have been even longer than that since Neil Armstrong stepped foot on the moon.
I hope that since then we will have been back to the moon in earnest.
