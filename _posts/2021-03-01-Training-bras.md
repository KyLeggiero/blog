Okay, I promise I have plenty of stuff I'm wanting to blog about that's not related to my <b class="sparkly">gender adventures</b>, but this is just something that's been nagging me recently.


# Let's define "Training Bra" #

Traditionally, we in the USA give young girls training bras. Why? [Well that's a whole thing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_bra#History), but here's my takeaway:

1. So they [is](/Pronouns#singularity-vs-plurality) familiar with the feeling of having a bra on and how to position & adjust it properly, and so it isn't so weird by the time they needs it for support
2. To provide padding to protect their growing [breast buds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_bud)
3. Social status among other kids; fashion

Alright, sounds pretty reasonable. Gotta get used to it anyway and it has _some_ utility in the meantime, and you might as well enjoy how it looks while you gotta wear it.

While I describe this, though, it reminds me of... well, me. [I've been taking hormones so I can grow boobs](/Non-Binary#growing-breasts) since last May. And that's going well! I don't yet have anything that needs support, but I've measured myself at a 32B cup already! As such, I need to wear a bra when I go out, to protect my sensitive still-growing chest, and so I'm used to wearing it by the time I need the support. I also enjoy the social value, chatting about bras and other boob stuff with my fellow trans friends.

Huh. Now, doesn't that sound familiar? **I wear training bras!** They offer no support nor shaping, either. The only difference is that they're big enough for me, a 30-year-old, to wear comfortably.

This feels obvious. I started growing breasts as a 29-year-old. For the same reason young girls need training bras, so do I!

Strangely, some people don't seem to understand this. They say that, since I'm an adult, I'm just wearing a bra or bralette. They say that I can't be wearing a training bra because I'm not a young girl. This is so silly to me and my friends! Of course I am wearing training bras - they're bras worn for the purpose of training!

I ain't even got anything more to say. It just feels so obvious that my 32Bs need a non-supportive bra, that anyone who thinks different just looks silly to me.
