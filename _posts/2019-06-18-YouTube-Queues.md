YouTube loves the idea of keeping me watching an endless stream of videos... and yet I cannot say which ones. Unless I'm casting, then I can queue up the next one. And I like that! I like having an ad-hoc list of videos I wanna watch play automatically. Why not just let me do that on my phone and desktop? ðŸ˜•
